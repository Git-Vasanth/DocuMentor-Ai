## How it Works

DocuMentor-AI utilizes a robust RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) pipeline to process and understand your documents:

1. **Server Initialization:** Upon server start, the system checks for an existing local vector database. If one doesn't exist, an empty one is created.
2. **Extraction & Transformation:** Uploaded documents (PDF, DOC/DOCX, TXT) or content from URLs are extracted and transformed into formatted text files.
3. **Embeddings:** The formatted text is then converted into numerical representations called embeddings, which are stored in a vector database.
4. **Query Processing:** When a user submits a query, it is also converted into a vector.
5. **Search & Retrieval:** The system performs a search within the vector database using techniques like Cosine Similarity and BM25 to find the most relevant document embeddings.
6. **Context Generation:** Relevant document contexts are extracted, keeping only unique documents.
7. **Response Generation:** The user query, along with the retrieved context and previous chat history, is fed into a prompt template to generate a comprehensive and accurate response.
8. **Dynamic Vector Database Updates:** New embeddings from uploaded documents are seamlessly added to the existing vector database, or a new one is created if none exists.

## Data Validation

DocuMentor-AI employs rigorous data validation using:

- **Packages:** DeepEval and Ragas.
- **Metrics:** Faithfulness, Context Precision, and Response Relevancy are used to evaluate the quality of the RAG pipeline's generator, assess the relevance of retrieved contexts, and determine how relevant a response is to the user input.

## Benchmarks

Measurements are based on logs, and all values represent averages.

| Pages       | Response Time | Model Accuracy (Faithfulness) |
|-------------|---------------|-------------------------------|
| 501 - 1k    | â‰¤ 1 Min       | 70-73%                        |
| 1k - 1.5k   | 2 - 3 Min     | AI: 9 Secs                   |
| 2k+         | 10+ Min       | AI: 1.1 Secs                 |
